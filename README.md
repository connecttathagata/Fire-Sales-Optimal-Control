# Fire-Sales-Optimal-Control

This is the code for the Optimal Control problem which arises when a bank is trying to minimize losses while liquidating assets to satisfy regulatory constraints. This is a multiasset generalization of Feinstein (2019) https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.02711.pdf.

I consider the case with two illiquid assets. I use Pontryagin Maximum Principle to solve the Optimal Control Problem.
